   • Overall Risk Score: {risk_score:.2f} / 1.00
   • Audit Status: {'CRITICAL' if risk_score >= 0.7 else 'FLAGGED' if risk_score >= 0.4 else 'PASSED'}

   Summary: This comprehensive ESG audit evaluates {supplier_name} across 
   environmental impact, regulatory compliance, and external risk factors. 
   The supplier has been classified as {classification} based on 
   emissions data and violation history. {reason}

2. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
   • Annual CO2 Emissions: {emissions} tons
   • Emissions Score: {state.get('emissions_score', 'N/A')} / 1.00
   • Industry Benchmark: {'Above average' if emissions > 5000 else 'Within normal range'}
   
   Analysis: {emissions_analysis}

3. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE REVIEW
   • Regulatory Violations: {violations} incidents
   • Violations Score: {state.get('violations_score', 'N/A')} / 1.00
   • Compliance Status: {'CRITICAL' if violations >= 5 else 'NON-COMPLIANT' if violations >= 2 else 'COMPLIANT'}
   
   Analysis: {violations_analysis}

4. EXTERNAL RISK FACTORS
   {external_risks}

5. POLICY ENFORCEMENT OUTCOME
   • Decision: {decision}
   • Human Approval Required: {'YES' if human_approval else 'NO'}
   • Recommended Action: {action}
   
   Rationale: {reason}

6. RISK MITIGATION RECOMMENDATIONS
{recommendations}

7. FINAL RECOMMENDATION
   {final_rec} Key success metrics include: emissions reduction 
   trajectory, violation remediation progress, and implementation of recommended 
   corrective actions. Regular monitoring will ensure continuous improvement and 
   alignment with our ESG standards.
